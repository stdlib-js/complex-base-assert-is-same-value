    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import isSameValue from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-base-assert-is-same-value@deno/mod.js';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the deno branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/complex-base-assert-is-same-value/tags). For example,

```javascript
import isSameValue from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-base-assert-is-same-value@v0.2.0-deno/mod.js';
```

#### isSameValue( z1, z2 )

Tests whether two double-precision complex floating-point numbers are the same value.

```javascript
import Complex128 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64@deno/mod.js';

var z1 = new Complex128( 5.0, 3.0 );
var z2 = new Complex128( 5.0, 3.0 );

var out = isSameValue( z1, z2 );
// returns true
```

In contrast to the strict equality operator `===`, the function distinguishes between `+0` and `-0` and treats `NaNs` as the same value.

```javascript
import Complex128 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64@deno/mod.js';

var z1 = new Complex128( NaN, NaN );
var z2 = new Complex128( NaN, NaN );

var out = isSameValue( z1, z2 );
// returns true

z1 = new Complex128( -0.0, 0.0 );
z2 = new Complex128( 0.0, -0.0 );

out = isSameValue( z1, z2 );
// returns false
```

## Notes

-   The function implements the [SameValue Algorithm][ecma-262-same-value-algorithm] as specified in ECMAScript 5.
